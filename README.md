The backend is built using Node.js with the Express.js framework. It follows a RESTful architecture for managing job data. The architecture is modular, separating concerns like routes,utility files from the entry point file.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js for handling HTTP requests.
- fs: A Node.js module for interacting with the file system, allowing oopeartions such as reading and writing. As a JSON file was used to as the databse, fs module was used to interact with the file.
- cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
